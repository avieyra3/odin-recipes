    </p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10lb fully cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup of pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of honey</li>
        <li>1/3 large orange</li>
        <li>2tbs of dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F 
            (165 degrees C). Place ham in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake ham uncovered in a preheated oven for 2hrs</li>
        <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar,
            pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. 
            Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in 
            the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; 
            whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes 
            to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze 
            thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add 
                lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make 
                it sweeter. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove ham from the oven after it has baked 
                for 2 hours. Brush with glaze. Bake for an 
                additional 30 to 45 minutes, brushing ham 
                with glaze every 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
